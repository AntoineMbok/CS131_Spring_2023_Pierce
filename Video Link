Check out my video on how computers play chess. I explore the algorithm used to help the computer make a decision as well as techniques to help make it more efficient and save time. I chose this topic as I enjoy playing chess, and for the longest time I wondered how computers are able to "think" about their moves. When professor Yuen mentioned it as a possible project idea, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to learn about it. If you have never played chess before, I go over just enough to get you started, but it is not a big component to understanding the algorithm. Be sure to like and smash the subscribe button! Thanks!
