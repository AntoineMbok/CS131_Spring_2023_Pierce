Hello everyone, I decided to dedicate my semester project to Big O Notation. Big O notation is a fundamental concept in Computer Science due to the importance of algorithms in CS careers. Big O notation allows us to analyze the efficiency of algorithms, which is very important to many CS careers. I mainly discuss the definition of Big O notation and its importance to Computer Science. I also briefly touch on Big Omega and Big Theta, as we learned them in class as well. Thank you.
